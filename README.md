# Offline tool to verify EOS keypairs

It has come to our attention that some members have generated public and
private key pairs on phishing sites.

Our team is working and coordinating with different teams to see how the rights
of these users can be safeguarded. If you believe you fall victim to these
sites, please immediately check you key pair by, e.g. trying to vote on a
trusted voting app. If voting isnâ€™t possible, this could mean you have fallen
victim to those fishing sites. If so, let us know and we will try and help you.

Please note that you should ask fast: if voting has reached 15% and the chain
becomes live, there will be no stopping the phishing sites to sell your EOS.
