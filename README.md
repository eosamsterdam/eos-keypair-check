# Offline tool to verify EOS keypairs

It has come to our attention that some members have generated public and private key pairs on phishing sites. **Your EOS funds might be compromised!**

Our team is working and coordinating with different teams to see how
the rights of these users can be safeguarded. You can check your
keypairs using this tool.  You can also try to check if your key pair
is compromised by trying to vote on a trusted voting app.

Please note that you should ask fast: if voting has reached 15% and the chain
becomes live, there will be no stopping the phishing sites to sell your EOS.
